Give me a prompt to create a fastapi fresh new project for github co-pilot dont use existing project
this will have a dataset, use sqllite3 for creating this dataset which will have the name_of_the_api, postman collections
load initial data into the dataset and give me a few get endpoints to fetch the data, make sure that there are no pylint issues, sonar issues
and security scan issues, since we are going to use github actions for this, make sure that there is documentation and pytest.  add the folder
structure as per the nbest practices, make sure to use python pep-8 make sure that the project is created in one prompt without rework which can be
setup and run in one go without any issues.
